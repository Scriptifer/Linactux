# Linactux 
Switch from Windows to Linux *without* needing a USB.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
While Linactux has been successfully tested on bare metal with Linux Mint, compatibility with all Linux distributions is *not* guaranteed. For best results, a USB installation is still recommended.
> 
Some distributions do not allow this type of automated installation media, there is a risk that you will end up stuck with the Linux installation with no other OS.
